Yield Farming: Magic money in Cryptocurrencies ?
====

Crop rotation

Yield farming is a process to generate more crypto-assets from an initial portfolio. Thought this can be seen as a 
passive revenue, we will probably use the term Yield farming when this process requires more activity than just earning dividends
from a stock capital.   

You have the growing field of DeFi, a many tools to extract the maximum value for short or mid-term from your seeds.

There are different layers of revenues

### Staking for security

When holding 32 ethers and a good computer, you can secure the Ethereum 2.0 network and earn some fees. Between 5% if
  there are many validators, and 20% if some validators are missing. If revenue is currently around 7%, and we should not expect much more.  

This is possible for assets that secure a blockchain, such as Fantom, Solana, Avax, etc.


### Liquidity Pool participation

In finance, liquidity is extremely important for various aspects. It can be currency exchange, putting collateral in front of a paper, etc. The 2009 crisis was also a liquidity crisis.

In the DeFi, you get rewards by sharing liquidities. With crypto `A` and crypto `B`, you  get a Liquidity Pool crypto named `LP A/B` . By clicking, or calling yourself web3.js lib, you can get your `A` and `B` back.

In the example of SushiSwap, a well-known decentralized exchange in Ethereum. You put ETH and DAI in a liquidity Pool. Some users that want to exchange their DAI in ETH will pay a little fee. Some users that also want to exchange ETH in DAI and pay a little fee. The not-so-tricky algorithm makes sure there is still ETH and DAI, and you also collect most of the fees, [having more ETH and DAI every minutes](https://help.sushidocs.com/products/sushiswap-pools) ... if users wants ETH and DAI.

### Code aparty

The beauty of the system is that you don't need to trust Dapps people or call bankers or lawyers to get you A & B back. You just call the code. So you have to read or trust the open source code. You can see Uniswap core code in [Github](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol).

The incredible thing is that it's less than a thousand lines, because when you code in the blockchain, database and user management is free. This short piece of code has been audited officially, and big whales who put big money in. But also by curious devs like me, as reading/copying open source code is a good way to learn quickly. 

As we will see, Uniswap code has also been copied in other blockchain exchanges. But if you can trust Uniswap code, it doesn't mean you should trust all Dapps code.



### Tokenomics

A bit of simple maths here.

Let's suppose ETH and DAI are real valuable money, and that SushiSwap developers and early investors have a lot of initial SUSHI tokens that were not worth anything at the platform creation. How do they convert SUSHI in real money ? Why would you buy SUSHI ? Why would you keep SUSHI in the long term ?

The first part of the mechanism of SushiSwap is simple, but let's detail it. 

Let say ETH is worse 3000$, and 1 DAI is 1$. You have 1 ETH, 3000 DAI and create  1 LP ETH-DAI. After one week, you have 1.005 LP ETH-DAI, equivalent to 5$ earning, and the platform will be rewarded with 0.001 LP ETH-DAI. Fair share.





### Staking for collecting fees



Developers proportional share in token is lowering, so they give up their long term share on the 0.001 LP against a short term amount of money by giving an immediate value of SUSHI. The long term value will be owned by SUSHI holders.

That's not a bad mechanism, way simpler than real-life deals. But it provokes some chain reaction.





Now a fight starts to get these 1/6th fee. That' sonly a 1/6th fee, but an capital allocation in SUSHI can be more juicy than putting your money in LP Tokens. How to get the more SUSHI.

That's the liquidity mining.

### Rewards from Dapps

A Decentralized Application, or Dapp, is a classic web application connecting to the Ethereum network and your wallet. It usually uses a 
common open source lib named web3.js and your wallet is often Metamask, a chrome extension, or [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/), a USB device.

So when you are using a Dapp, you often have some rewards to use this Dapp.  



Where is a catch ? 



- Liquidity mining
  
- leverage
- risk
- impermanent losses

If have eth, can put them as collateral, borrow more,
and use the borrowed asset as new collateral to borrow more

LP Token *represents* a participation in a liquidity pool
You have some rewards to participate in it when you stake
LP tokens.
